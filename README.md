Oud Maestro Ultimate  (https://mahdidahmani.github.io/Instrument/)

A web-based interactive fretboard visualizer and luthier tool. I built this to help visualize notes, scales, and chords on fretless instruments like the Oud, as well as Guitar and Bass.

Unlike standard tools, this supports microtonal scales (Maqams) with quarter-tones, making it useful for oriental music theory.

Key Features:

Multi-Instrument: Presets for Oud (Arabic, Turkish, Iraqi, etc.), Guitar, Bass, and Violin.

Scale & Chord Library: Visualize Western scales (Major, Minor, Blues...) and Oriental Maqams (Rast, Bayati, Hijaz...) directly on the neck.

Microtonal Support: Accurately renders quarter-tones (half-flats) for Maqams.

Audio Engine: Real-time sound synthesis using the Web Audio API (no external samples). Click or drag across strings to play.

Customizable: Change tuning, scale length (cm), and toggle measurements.

Bilingual: Fully localized in English and French.

Tech Stack:

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

HTML5 Canvas (for the rendering engine)

Web Audio API (for sound generation)

No external frameworks or libraries.
